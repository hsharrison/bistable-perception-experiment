instructions:
    - >
        Thank you for agreeing to participate in this experiment.
        We will start with a series of instructions.
        On each page, press ENTER to continue.
        If you become confused at any point, ask the experimenter for clarification before continuing.

    - >
        This experiment involves the way people see various pictures.
        You will first look at a picture for a short time,
        then decide whether the picture looks like a man's face or like a woman's figure.
        
    - discrete: >
        After each picture is displayed, press the left arrow key if it looks like a woman's figure,
        or the right arrow key if it looks like a man's face
        (you will be reminded of these keys).
        Even if the picture is ambiguous, you should choose between left (woman's figure) and right (man's face).

      continuous: >
        After each picture is displayed, you will rate the picture on a scale by moving the cursor left and right using the arrow keys.
        Moving the cursor to the left signifies "looks more like a woman's figure";
        moving the cursor to the right signifies "looks more like a man's face"
        (you will be reminded which is which).
        If the cursor looks completely like a woman's figure, move the cursor all the way to the left.
        If the picture looks completely like a man's face, move the cursor all the way to the right.
        If the picture is ambiguous, leave the cursor closer to the middle.
        Tapping the arrow keys will move the cursor slowly;
        hold them down to move the cursor quickly.

    - >
        We will start with two examples.
        First you will see a picture, then you will see the correct response.
        The first example is a picture of man's face.
        It will disappear automatically after a few seconds.

    - _example_man

    - >
        The second example is a picture of woman's figure.
        As before, it will disappear automatically after a few seconds.

    - _example_woman

    - >
        In the actual experiment, the picture will be visible for a shorter period.
        After the picture disappears, you will have 5 seconds to make your response.
        Then the next picture will appear automatically.

    - >
        Now we will practice giving a response.
        There will be no image; this is just to get used to moving the cursor with the arrow keys.
        Press ENTER to continue, then press an arrow key to move the cursor.
        After 5 seconds, we will automatically move on.

    - _example_response

    - In the experiment, your response is determined by the location of the cursor at the end of the 5 seconds.

    - >
        This is the end of the instructions.
        Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions.
        When you are ready, press ENTER to begin.

example_response_message: >
    This is the correct response to the previous image.
    The cursor is denoted by the big letter x in  brackets: "|X|".
    It is shown below as if you had already pressed the {} arrow key.
    If this makes sense to you, press ENTER to continue.

interblock_message: >
    The experiment is now {}/3 complete.
    Take a short break and press ENTER when you are ready to continue.

exit_message: >
    You have reached the end of the experiment.
    Feel free to ask any questions you may have about this research.
    Thank you for participating!
